A few notes on randomised maps
------------------------------

As of version 1.1 of the Keen 1 Randomiser, the LEVEL??.CK1 files have been
modified to contain additional item locations. This was suggested by
KeenRush[1], and works as follows:

- If multiple keycards of the same colour are present, these act as
  different possible locations for one keycard. This means that all of them,
  except for one, will be replaced with the grey sky tile.
- The first frame of the joystick (tile 221) must be present in every level.
  It represents a possible location for a special item (the pogo stick or
  ship parts). Only one such item will be placed in a level.
- Make sure these possible keycards and items are accessible without the
  pogo stick (as it's possible that Keen won't have it), and are not
  behind a door they're needed to open.
- The exit door will not function until the special item in a level has 
  been found, so it's safe to hide it somewhere far from the exit.
  (It might be frustrating, though, if it's hidden somewhere too silly.)
